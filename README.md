## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
bun run build
```

This is currently deployed using Cloudflare pages.
